=head1 NAME

XML::Grammar::Fiction - CPAN distribution implementing an XML grammar 
and a lightweight markup language for stories, novels and other fiction.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.0.1

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.0.1';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<XML::Grammar::Fiction::FromProto>, 
L<XML::Grammar::Fiction::ToDocBook> and
L<XML::Grammar::Fiction::ToHTML>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

XML::Grammar::Fiction is a CPAN distribution that facilitates writing prose
fiction (= stories, novels, novellas, etc.). What it does is:

=over 4

=item 1. Converting a well-formed plain text format to a specialized XML format.

=item 2. Converting the XML to DocBook/XML or directly to HTML for rendering.

=back

The best way to use it non-programatically is using
L<XML::Grammar::Fiction::App::FromProto>,
L<XML::Grammar::Fiction::App::ToDocBook> and
L<XML::Grammar::Fiction::App::ToHTML>, which are modules implementing
command line applications for their processing.

The rest of this page will document the syntax of the custom textual format.

=head1 FORMAT

=head2 Scenes

Sections are placed in XML-like tags of C<< <section> ... </section> >> or
abbreviated as C<< <s> ... </s> >>. Opening tags in the format may have 
attributes whose keys are plaintext and whose values are surrounded by
double quotes. (Single-quotes are not supported).

The section tag must have an C<id> attribute (for anchors, etc.) and could
contain an optional (but highly recommended) C<< <title> >> sub-tag. If the 
title is not specified, it will default to the ID.

Sections may be B<nested>. 

=head2 Text

Text is any of:

=over 4

=item 1. Plaintext

Regular text

=item 2. XML-like tags.

Supported tags are C<< <b> >> for bold text, and C<< <i> >> for italic
text.

=item 3. Entities

The text format supports SGML-like entities such as C<< &amp; >>,
C<< &lt; >>, C<< &quot; >> and all other entities that are supported by 
L<HTML::Entities>.

=item 4. Supported initial characters

The following characters can start a regular paragraph:

=over 4

=item * Any alphanumeric character.

=item * Some special characters:

The characters C<"> (double quotes), C<'> (single quotes), etc. are supported.

=item * XML/SGML entities.

XML/SGML entities are also supported at the start. 

=back

All other characters are reserved for special markup in the future. If you
need to use them at the beginning of the paragraph you can escape them with
a backslash (C<\>) or their SGML/XML entity (e.g: C<&qout;>).

=back

=head2 EXAMPLES

Examples can be found in the C<t/data> directory, and here:

=over 4

=item * The Pope Died on Sunday

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-xml-grammar-fiction at rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=XML-Grammar-Fiction>.
I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on
your bug as I make changes.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item * Implement the correct handlind of leading special characters in lines.

=item * Check that SGML entities work properly.

=item * Convert the parsing errors from Carp::confess to Exception::Class

This will allow a friendlier diagnostic. Carp::confess was implemented due to
laziness on the programmers' part.

=back

=head1 MOTIVATION

I wrote this CPAN distribution so I'll have a convenient way to edit a story
I'm writing in Hebrew and other fiction like that, as OpenOffice.org caused
me many problems, and I found editing bi-directional DocBook/XML to be
painful with either gvim or KDE 4's kate, so I opted for a more plain-texty
format.

I hope a lightweight markup language like that for fiction (and possibly
other types of manuscripts) will prove useful for other writers. At the
moment, a lot of stuff in the proto-text format is subject to change,
so you'll need to accept that some modifications to your sources will be
required in the future. I hope you still find it useful and let me know
if you need any feature or bug-fix.
