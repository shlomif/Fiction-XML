=head1 NAME

XML::Grammar::Screenplay::ToDocBook - module that converts the Screenplay
XML to DocBook.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.4.1

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.4.1';

=head2 new()

Accepts no arguments so far. May take some time as the grammar is compiled
at that point.

=head2 meta()

Internal - (to settle pod-coverage.).

=cut

=head2 $converter->translate_to_docbook({source => {file => $filename}, output => "string" })

Does the actual conversion. $filename is the filename to translate (currently
the only available source). 

The C<'output'> key specifies the return value. A value of C<'string'> returns 
the XML as a string, and a value of C<'xml'> returns the XML as an 
L<XML::LibXML> DOM object.

=cut

sub translate_to_docbook
{
    my ($self, $args) = @_;

    return $self->perform_translation($args);
}
