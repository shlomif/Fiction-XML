<title>Goliath's Response</title>

<!-- Goliath has to reply to that. -->

Goliath was not amused.

He said to David: "Oh, really. <i>David</i>, the red-headed!".

David started listing Goliath's disadvantages:

<blockquote>

<ol>

<li>

You're slow.

</li>

<li>

You're big.

</li>

<li>

You're stupid.

</li>

</ol>

Goliath was insulted and told David he should use bullets for the points, 
instead:

<ul>

<li>

David.

</li>

<li>

Saul.

</li>

<li>

Jonathan.

</li>

<li>

Michal.

</li>

<li>

Meyrav.

</li>

</ul>

</blockquote>
